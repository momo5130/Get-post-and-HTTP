    <h1>HTTP1.1 </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Introduced in 1997.
        </li>
        <li>Internet ecosystem was changing at a rapid pase.</li>
        <li>During that duration more search engines and websites were being created with heavy pages having more images and data, and also the resource usage increased.</li>
        <li>
            In order to cope-up with that, more features were required.
        </li>
        <li>Addition to the fatures of HTTP1, HTTP1.1 came up with features like CORS, Keep-alive to make internet fast.</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    
    
    

    <h3>Flaws in HTTP1.1 </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Header information is repeated in every request, which cannot be compressed, even though the data can be compressed.
        </li>
        <li>More focused on gzip, minifying CSS/JS, caching etc.</li>
        <li>
            TCP connection gets blocked till the response is received. 
        </li>
        <li>
            HTTP1.1 has 6 TCP connection which were still not enough for the clients.
        </li>
        <li>
            Keep-alive  option enables re-using of the same TCP connection for multiple HTTP request.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h1>HTTP2.0 </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            HTTP2.0 came in 2015
    
        </li>
        <li>
            HTTP2.0 is build on top of HTTP1.1, which includes all the features of HTTP1.1. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Features of HTTP2.0</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In HTTP2.0 single secured TCP connection is being used, in which streams are created in which every HTTP request is sent as a stream or stream frame. 
            So single TCP connection pipeline is used and in that it is compulsory to have TLS setup, which makes it faster. We don't have to create mutiple TCP connections.
        </li>
        <li>
            In HTTP2, HPACK was added, which separates the Header data from the request and can be zipped.
    
        </li>
        <li>
            HPACK enables automatic caching of Header data which reduces HTTP request size

        </li>
        <li>
            PUSH frames were also included in HTTP2.0 which enables the client to send mandatory resources in advance along with an HTTP response.

        </li>
    </ul>
